* Emacs Bluetooth Mode

  This package provides a simple Bluetooth mode that can be used to manage
  Bluetooth devices on GNU/Linux using GNU Emacs.

  Implemented features are:
  - (un-)pairing devices
  - (dis-)connecting
  - discovery mode
  - setting device properties (alias, blocked, trusted)
  - setting adapter properties (powered, discoverable, pairable)
  - showing device information (alias, address, RSSI, class, services)
  - Imenu integration

  The implementation is based on the Bluez DBus interface (see
  [[https://www.bluez.org]]).

** Usage

   To install it, invoke ~M-x package-install-file~ on  ~bluetooth.el~
   and then  use it with ~M-x bluetooth-list-devices~.

   The mode assumes availability of Bluez on D-Bus.  Depending on the system
   configuration, Bluez may use the ~:system~ bus or the ~:session~ bus.  This
   can be configured by using ~M-x customize~ to set the ~bluetooth-bluez-bus~
   variable in the ~Communication/Bluetooth~ menu to either the symbol
   ~:system~ or ~:session~, as appropriate.

*** Notes

    - Discoverable mode is usually deactivated after 3 minutes, as configured
      in the ~bluetoothd~ configuration file (e.g. ~/etc/bluetooth/main.conf~.)
    - Blocking a connected device will disconnect it.
    - If a device is trusted, authorisation of services is not required when
      connecting; devices are not trusted automatically.
    - Adapter commands always use the first adapter found in the system
      (i.e. reported by Bluez.)
